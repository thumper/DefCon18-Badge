Module "SCI1"      (bean Init_SCI_56800)
   - SCI1_Init -This method initializes registers of the SCI module according to this Peripheral Initialization settings.   
                Call this method in the user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE 
                automatically; see "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "Cpu"       (bean 56F8006_32_LQFP)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables all maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables all maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_SetWaitMode -Sets low power mode - Wait mode.  For more information about the wait mode see this CPU documentation.  
                Release from wait mode: Reset or interrupt
   - Cpu_SetStopMode -Sets low power mode - Stop mode.  For more information about the stop mode see this CPU documentation.
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. Adding read wait states for external program memory can 
                cause delay extension as well. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
